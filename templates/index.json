It is considered a G-protein biased agonist, meaning it activates pain-relieving pathways without strongly triggering the β-arrestin-2 pathway (which is responsible for many opioid side effects like respiratory depression and constipation).</p><p>Neither compound strongly activates the κ-opioid or δ-opioid receptors, which helps explain the euphoria and pain relief with minimal dysphoria in most kratom users.<br/><br/>Kratom’s unique pharmacology lies in this partial, biased agonism at MOR with relatively clean receptor selectivity, offering potential for pain relief with fewer side effects.</p>"
